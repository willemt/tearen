tearen
===============

tearen is a 2D multi-platform OpenGL renderer written in C under the BSD license

tearen has the following objectives:
* Be a renderer, and just a renderer
* Be easy to use through a very approachable API
* Be fast by optimizing behind the scenes
* Be platform independent by being OpenGL ES compatible

NOTE: The renderer is in alpha and is not yet suitable for everyday use.
